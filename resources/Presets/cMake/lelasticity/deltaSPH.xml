<!-- deltaSPH.xml
delta-SPH is a method to reduce the pressure field noise through the
introduction of a diffusive term inside the mass conservation equation.

Such term is based in the computation of the pressure Laplacian.

In principle, the Laplacian is computed using the Morrison formula, and no
correction is added. However it is strongly recommended to add a correction
(since it will become inconsistent close to the boundaries):
  - If the pressure field will be heavily dominanted by the hidrostatic
  component, the simplified correction deltaSPH-simple.xml can be used.
  - Otherwise the MLS based correction deltaSPH-full.xml will be applied.

Remember that after including this preset, a new property for each particles set
should be imposed, the delta factor (in principle 0.0 or 1.0)
