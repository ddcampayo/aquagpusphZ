/** @brief Velocity divergence computation
 *
 * Since we already computed the gradient of the velocity, we can get the
 * divergence as the sum of the diagonal components:
 * \f[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = \sum_i^d \left(\nabla \mathbf{u}\right)_ii \f]
 *
 * @param imove Moving flags.
 *   - imove = 2 for regular solid particles.
 *   - imove = 0 for sensors (ignored by this preset).
 *   - imove < 0 for boundary elements/particles.
 * @param rho Density \f$ \rho \f$.
 * @param grad_u Gradient of the deformation \f$ \nabla \mathbf{r}^{*} \f$.
 * @param div_u Velocity divergence \f$ \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \f$.
 * @param N Number of particles.
